Question: Write a website that gets car type and returns a car from it.  
 Notes: 
• Car type can be electrical, 2 wheels or sport 
• Each car type might have different parts 
• You are free to make any assumption, for example about car parts but please mention it in your answer   
• You will be assessed based on 
• Code quality • Thinking process and logic
• Software Design
• It would be fine if you have a non-working application as our assessment is not about finishing but more on code itself
